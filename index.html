          <h1>To My Silly Baby</h1>
        <p>I wonder how your day has been. If you’d ask me its been hectic so hectic, gosh I just wanted to sleep so this could pass by faster, I don’t think ill be any good without you, my day’s been terrible I hope your was better baby, I want to stay with you. Your presence alone is so ethereal it’s so calming, it’s spiritual.</p>
        <p>Recently the days been worse for me and also the fact that you also have more and more pressure from the upcoming examinations, the horror of the real world, I hope I could be your temporary escape from all the worries, I don’t want you to worry or be worried because of me, I want you to see me your escape from reality, a place, a home where you can come back to, nobody judges you, nobody asks you to do your duties you can just come home and feel safe.</p>
        <p>That’s how I feel for you baby, that’s how I feel, oh gosh we’d make one hell of pair a literally, we’re not going to heaven are we?</p>
        <p>Sometimes I think that somehow if I could take in enough bruises or pain, enough scars, enough sacrifices, so that at the end of time, when its the judgement, I would be chained in hell, Id sacrifice my soul so that your soul attains heaven… Right now I want to take you deep into a fantasy world, not very real right now, well its not really fantasy its how I feel and see, It's tangible to some extent, maybe I could show you how much I admire you.</p>
        <p>Ive stopped praying recently, I think I just stopped for no reason, oh how I wish for you and me to be forever whenever I wish for something, you know the thing where if your eyelash falls off place it on the palm of your hand say your prayers and blow it away… its a silly thing I believe, oh lord wish I could tell you what I’ve been wishing for since we’ve been together, if I speak of it, it won’t come true right? Oh so I will keep wishing and praying everyday to the all mighty that my prayers come true, the prayers of my childhood have come true, I now understand that for more than a decade since I was 4-5 I prayed of you, I prayed of you crossing paths with mine somehow, all the wishes came true… and now you’re here with me, all I could ever ask for all I could ever need is you.</p>
        <p>I might’ve committed some great virtue to get this great love, oh you don’t know how badly I want to talk to you… well isn’t how things went in earlier times? Months apart nothing but letters, the joy and happiness from the receiving a single letter, its so… so mystical</p>
        <p>Some things are meant to be baby, whether the world rips us apart, or our spirits waiver, but in the end the things which are meant to be come back together, no matter how long it takes.</p>
        <p>If the ending is not happy, Its not the ending its not the ending at all, I even in death want to dance with your soul to the songs we love, I want to watch the shows you love with you, I want you to know, I believe id heal all your wounds and take all your tears, go yes satan or sin whatever is it, it overcomes me, I am a sinner, I want to be a god’s man, I want to love you unconditionally, I want to be loved by you unconditionally too, oh yes its immature but we’re still discovering right? Oh I don’t want to hear people say you should explore more options, like NO… that’s so dumb, I want to spend a whole lifetime with you, before you I had been so lost, and now I am something, something worth, not as worth yet, ill be your ideal man, ill be everything you’ll ever need.</p>
        <p>oh as you read this its probably our 15th month complete or I convey you this directly right as soon as the the clock hits 12, and its 9th April.</p>
        <p>I want me to be your last Kiss</p>
        <p>I want you to be my last kiss</p>
        <p>I am literally seconds away from a heart attack</p>
        <p>I honestly I can’t believe I get to call you mine</p>
        <p>Your lips against mine, your hand running through my hair, we kiss each other in love, its a dark and ambient mood in the atmosphere, the music you in baby its.. its so beautiful, us kissing not stopping once, so in love, I don’t know if we’ll be alive tomorrow so ill love you everyday like its the last day, id love you… you my love, your lips evoke emotions within me that I didn’t know existed, your eyes… they’re my whole universe, your hair oh its like how a river flows, its all serene, your nose is cute, your voice, its a melody id never get tired of listening to.</p>
        <p>Whenever I close my eyes all I see is you, you’re in my everything, every action every step… the love you’ve taught me about flows through me, I feel your presence engulfing me, its… so warm and comforting… all because of you I am able to put love in everything I do… all that I ever wanna do, you give me more of a reason to not fall back and just set back, and even if I do fallback you love me so much that I get back on my feet… I am able to achieve more do more.. oh gosh your love is a blessing I could’ve never imagined how I’d survive without you? I worship our love, I am head over heels for you, as I type this I cry tears of joy, tears of love… just holding your hands feels like… feels like I can let my guard down nothing can hurt me in the world if my babygirl is with me.. you’re my heartbeat… and yes you’re actually funny, so adorable so cute, so… perfect, oh I have to do other preparations… but I just</p>
        <p>I just want to say…</p>
        <p>Krisha. Quacky. Garlic. Babygirl. My silly coon.</p>
        <p>I love you.</p>
        <p>I love you so much you don’t even know. This isn’t even anything. I love you. I love your ways. I love the way you just make everything colorful in my life. You are magic baby, you’re a miracle, you’re my angel…</p>
        <p>I don't know if I would have been alive had I never met you, you made me understand what life really means, what’s the purpose… there is a purpose everyone has a purpose you taught me what it was… ill fulfill my purpose and I want you to be there, I love you maybe its too much too ask for but… I love you and I need in all my highs and even in my lowest…</p>
        <p>Every heart beat of mine whispers your names</p>
        <p>I love you baby…</p>
        <p>
          Forever yours, <br>
